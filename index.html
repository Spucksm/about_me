                <p>Welcome to my page. My name is Spenser, and I hail from the great sate of Washington residing in the Pacific NorthWest. I am 32 years old,and I grew up playing soccer. It is one of my favorite sports to this day. Go Sounders! Although I was raised in the PNW and enjoy fishing, I do not like to eat fish. Its a conundrum I know. Lastly, I enjoy coding but I can always seem to find errors in what I write. I know I should be less critical as I still have lots to learn. Anyways, enjoy the fruits of my labor!
